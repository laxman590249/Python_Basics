Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class or module should have only one reason to change.

Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules;
both should depend on abstractions.
